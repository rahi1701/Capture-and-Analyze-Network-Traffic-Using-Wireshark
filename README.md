 Analyze Captured Packets:
 =========================
# 1. Examine Packets:
Wireshark displays captured packets, showing details like source/destination, protocol, and length. 

# 2. Filter Packets:
Use filters to narrow down the data based on specific criteria (e.g., IP address, protocol, port). 

# 3. Follow Streams:
Right-click on a packet and select "Follow" to view all packets in a specific conversation stream. 

# 4. Analyze Statistics:
Use Wireshark's statistics features to get a high-level overview of network activity.
